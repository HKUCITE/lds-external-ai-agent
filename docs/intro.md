# 1. Purpose

This specification defines the standard format for responses sent by external AI agents to the Learning Design System (LDS).

Goals:

- Ensure all responses are machine-readable, unambiguous, and safe for LDS to execute.
- Provide a clear, consistent structure for all LDS actions.
- Allow coexistence of conversational text (chat_message_reply) with one or more primary actions.
