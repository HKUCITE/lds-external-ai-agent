# 8. Error Handling

The LDS External AI Agent interface requires strict adherence to the defined JSON error response format to ensure feedback is clear, precise, and actionable for both humans and automated systems.

When an AI agent processes a request and encounters issues (e.g., missing fields, invalid values, unsupported types), it must return a standardized error response.

Goals:

- Provide consistent machine-readable feedback for automated fixing.
- Provide human-readable explanations for developers and testers.
- Pinpoint exact locations in the JSON payload where issues occur, allowing targeted corrections without scanning the entire request.
